## Installation and Requirements
+ `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter-notebook` (if running locally)
* Anaconda distribution of Python.
* Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
+ Families moving to a new neighborhood face many hardships, from understanding the community and its people, learning the area, finding a job, and finding a place to live. The objective of this project is to help people that are planning to move by finding the best fit neighborhood at the new residence. People will sometimes have little knowledge about the new residence and its surroundings when relocating. Therefore, using socioeconomic data and venue data from different neighborhoods will help find neighborhood similarity based on those two data sources. It would be helpful to have a comparison between the most important neighborhoods in where they are moving to and where they used to reside. This will help find out which are similar.
